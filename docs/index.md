A python module for getting useful data out of ixbrl files. The library is at an early stage - feedback and improvements are very welcome.

## Requirements

The module requires [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) and [lxml](https://lxml.de/) to parse the documents.

[word2number](https://github.com/akshaynagpal/w2n) is used to process the
numeric items with the `numsenwords` format.

## How to install

You can install from pypi using pip:

```
pip install ixbrlparse
```

## Acknowledgements

Originally developed for a project with 
[Power to Change](https://www.powertochange.org.uk/) looking at how to extract data from 
financial documents of community businesses.
